            Where I grew Up
        </h2>
        <p>I grew up in NYC with a brief period over in Florida as young child. New York has always felt apart of me,
            from the crowded
            subways, dodging through people in the city, to the quitness and serene views of upstate. The city is apart
            of me, even though sometimes I consider leaving and never coming back, the pull is too strong.

        <h2>My interests</h2>
        <p>I've always loved art, technology, and video games. You can always find me at a computer desk, or drawing in
            a notebook. My love
            for technology and video games developed into an interest in how to make them. I've found a passion in
            programming,
            and developing games. I spend almost all my free time outside of class teaching myself something or working
            on personal projects.
